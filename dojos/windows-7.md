# Free Windows 7, 8 & 10.

Microsoft maintains a set of Virtual Images intended fopr development purposes. When we need a windows 7 environment these can be leveraged for our purposes.

Luckly Microsoft maintains a number of evaluation mode ready OVAs [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/). Because these are OVAs, we can import them like our Kali image in the main lab.
